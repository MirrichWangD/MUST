I would like to express my deep gratitude to Professor xxx and
Professor xxx, my research supervisors, for their patient
guidance, enthusiastic encouragement and useful critiques of
this research work.

I would also like to extend my thanks to the technicians of the
laboratory of the xxx department for their help in offering me the
resources in running the program.
Finally, I wish to thank my parents and brothers for their support
