The template can be used in online and offline ways. For the former (highly recommended), 
Overleaf (\url{https://www.overleaf.com}) is a collaborative cloud-based LaTeX editor used for writing, editing and publishing scientific documents, which is much easy to use and friendly. In overleaf, the compiling command is \textcolor{blue}{XeLatex}.

For the latter, one can use Texstudio, which is a very popular yet free software package (\url{https://www.texstudio.org/}). When using Texstudio, the compiling command is \textcolor{blue}{XeLatex}. To make Texstudio work, one need to first install \textcolor{blue}{Miktex}, see \url{https://miktex.org/}. We happen to find, rather rarely, that a successful compiling may depend on the version of Texstudio. In any case, we recommend the latest version of Texstudio.
